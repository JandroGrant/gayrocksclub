The atmosphere, the world, the lyrics; Quadeca manages to really make every part of this album count. Lyrics calling back to different songs within, the song titles themselves. The best part is the album doesn't even demand you pay attention to the lyrics, the production is fucking fantastic. Each song sounds so unique without sacrificing the album integrity. Not to mention the features; Danny Brown, Sunday Service Choir, and Thor Harris are such good features that contribute so much and were chosen so well by Ben.",
